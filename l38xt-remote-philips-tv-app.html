Hi guys, I recently bought LG with webOS and I'm somehow disappointed with the OS itself. I think I want to switch to something with AndroidTV (either Sony or Philips). However before I do the switch I have 2 questions: 1) LG has 'quick access' function that gives the possibility to use numeric 1-9 buttons on the remote as shortcuts to chosen apps. For example 'long-press 1' = HBO GO, 'long-press 2' = Youtube. That's actually quite nice. Can I do something similar with AndroidTV Sony/Philips. –ó–∞–≥—Ä—É–∑–∏—Ç–µ –∏ —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—Ç–µ –ø—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ Philips TV Remote App. –≠—Ç–æ –±–µ—Å–ø–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–æ –∏ –¥–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø–Ω–æ –¥–ª—è —É—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π—Å—Ç–≤ –Ω–∞ –±–∞–∑–µ –û–° Android –∏ iOS. –° –ø–æ–º–æ—â—å—é –ø—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è Philips TV Remote –Ω–∞ –≤–∞—à–µ–º –º–æ–±–∏–ª—å–Ω–æ–º —É—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π—Å—Ç–≤–µ –≤—ã –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç–µ —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª—è—Ç—å.
