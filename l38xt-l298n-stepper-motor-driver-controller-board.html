                            <p>svitel: Информационно-поисковая система по прайс-листам предприятий электроники. Hi, amp#x200B; Yesterday I finally took my homemade rover for a test drive. I noticed that whenever I activate the motor driver, the servos on the rover went bananas. I tried disconnecting the control signal wire going to the servos, but it did not help. So it looks to me like motor driver causes a lot of noise on the power supply, and the servos are quite sensitive to it. amp#x200B; I'm a newbie when it comes to electronics, but I've learned in school that I can use a capacitor Hi I'm looking to drive 4 gear motors like these (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13302) for a rover project. I have been looking at both a L293D (https://www.elextra.dk/details/H10172/motor-stepper-servo-shield-til-arduino-v10-l293d) and L298N (https://www.elextra.dk/details/H28064/2-kanal-l298n-h-bridge-dc-motor-drive-controller-til-arduino) based motor driver board, but as I'm not very versed in electronics yet, I don't know which to choose of the two, or if there is something Hi I'm working on a project to automatically open and close my blinds. The project is made up of a stepper motor, a stepper motor driver, a small wifi module, and an arduino nano. I plan to have it intergrated with home assisstant. I have tried using a small stepper motor (55N cm ) however there is simply not enough torque (to open and close the blinds). My blinds are this style link (https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=iamprct=jampq=ampesrc=sampsource=imagesampcd=ampcad=rjaampuact=8. TLDR: If this seems to long to read or you're just interested enough to read a tl:dr, I get that, its someone elses noob project, so in essence, Im wondering about what motor drivers/motors/power system to use for this little cheap first pi bot. --- --- Im looking to make a little moving robot to play around with. Im not sure what I want it to be or what I want it to do yet but I probably will want to get a camera, program it to pick up/recognize or something to that effect. Hey Guys, can anyone help me out with my motorcontroller? I ordered this ( motorcontroller from SainSmart using the l298n chip, but only found documentation for this board (https://imgur.com/BKEO9m5). For pwm, my controller has the same ena and enb pins, but also 5V next to it, which the other one hasn't. Can anyone tell me what to do with them? Thanks in advance, Malte.

Just need some advice on a new project I'm working on at the moment. Using an arduino uno, will it be possible for me to drive two stepper motors fully independently (four wire) with two of this driver ( ), and still have three PWM pins remaining for driving an RGB led array (one pin for each colour Hi, everybody. I'm working on an arduino powered RC tank. I have some of these tanks ( pic ( and an arduino promini, 2.4ghz DSMX receiver, L298N based motor controller ( from ebay. Here's the sketch (https://gist.github.com/. Hi, I recently bought 2 geared motors and a H-bridge shield (I already had the Uno): those are the motors ( And this is the shield (http://www.ebay.com/itm/1PCS-L298N-Dual-Stepper-Motor-Driver-Controller-Board-Module-RED-GOOD-QUALITY/290891551458?_trksid=p2047675.m1850amp_trkparms=aid%3D333005%26algo%3DRIC.FIT%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D12%26meid%3. I'm interested in upgrading my motors on my rover robot. I am using the rover on a carpeted floor, and with rubber wheels. I need help in selecting a motor upgrade. I have a great coupon (from reddit gold) for  off  and I want to upgrade the motors with it. I think the most important item to address is overcoming the friction I experience. It is impossible to turn on the spot using opposite wheel directions. And turning at all is very tough. So I believe I would want something. 
Hello everyone! I have been following this tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbCdNh0TiUo) and I have the EXACT same components that he has in the video and the EXACT same setup. The ONLY thing different is that I have one small DC motor (that can run perfectly if connected to a single 1.5V AA battery), and instead of his battery pack, I am using a single 1.5V AA battery. I am new to electronics, but fairly educated with python. Is my small DC motor or single battery messing something. I have a few stepper motors, a few stepper motor controller boards (simple 200APR ( and more complex L298N ( and this one ( I have DC motors, and I have a digital I/O board ( that I can control 10 pins at TTL voltage. What I can't. I'm playing with stepper motors and I've come across two different drivers for a 4 wire motor. A few people have suggested that the L298N doesn't work with a pi because the GPIO pins only put out 3.3volts, but I've seen some other posts with people using them. Does anybody know how these two drivers are different and which one works with the pi and a small 4 wire stepper motor from a scanner.
